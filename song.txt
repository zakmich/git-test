How you doing, young lady?
That feeling that you giving really drives me crazy
You're dope have a player 'bout to choke
I was at a loss of words first time that we spoke

You looking for a girl that'll treat you right
Have you looking for her in the daytime with the light
You might be the type if I play my cards right
I'll find out by the end of the night
